    <h1><p>Produced by Toyota since 2019, the GR Supra (model code J29/DB or A90/A91 for marketing purposes) is a sports automobile.<br>\
         The Toyota Gazoo Racing (TGR) brand worked with BMW to develop and market the GR Supra, the fifth generation of the Supra. It is the A80 Supra's replacement, after the latter's manufacture was discontinued in 2002.<br>

        With a short wheelbase, wide track, and low center of gravity,<br> the revolutionary sports vehicle platform that Toyota and BMW jointly developed is the basis for the GR Supra and the G29 BMW Z4.[10][11] Tada-san, the top engineer of BMW, first suggested that the new Supra be built on a pre-existing platform of their own.[12] The Magna Steyr facility located in Graz, Austria, produces both automobiles.[13]

    <h1><p>1998 saw the release of the Skyline R34, the tenth generation.<br>
         In order to maximize motion performance and maintain adequate internal space in a smaller body, the body was quite stiff. Released in 1999, the "GT-R" model is its highest performance model. The "V⋅spec" garnered a lot of attention because of its race car-inspired appearance, specially tuned springs, active LSD, and distinctive aero elements that improved traveling performance.
        The 2000 addition of V-spec II featured aluminum pedals and a carbon engine hood with *NACA duct, <br>
        creating a Spartan environment. This vehicle is a special edition V-spec II in the color "Bayside Blue."
