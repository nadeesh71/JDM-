    <h1><p>Land Rover Discontinued Steel Wheels, but You Might Not Notice</p></h1><br>

    <img src="./Images/def.jpg " height="700"><br>




    <h1><p>For the Defender model, Land Rover will no longer be selling 18-inch steel wheels after 2024.<br>
         The bad news is that.
        The good news is that the mid-size luxury SUV is available with a set of white-painted aluminum wheels that closely resemble the steelies that Land Rover fans like.<br>
        s
        The Defender County package includes them, and each one weighs eight pounds less than the steelies that came before it.
