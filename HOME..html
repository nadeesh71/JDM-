    <h1><p>On November 4, 1998, at around four in the morning,<br>Kazuhiko "Smokey" Nagata shifted from the hard shoulder into lane two on the A1(M) and stopped.<br>
         As the rain started to fall and the temperature was just above freezing,<br> he let go of the clutch, pinned the throttle, and executed an incredible burnout in the middle of the road. He drove his massively modified, 1,003 horsepower, Japanese-registered, gold-painted Toyota Mk.4 Supra with the intention of reaching 200 mph, content that the Midlands had been sufficiently covered in tire smoke.</p></h1>
